My personal neural data analysis toolkit.

List of intended indexes (TODO):

1) phase modulation index
2) prelick modulation index
3) orientation and direction selectivity indexes
4) response surprise and cv
5) compute whitened z-scored STA

List of intended anlysis bloks (TODO):

1) median comparison (violin + hc similarity matrix)
2) psth + mean and se firing + example surprise computation
3) behavior computation of smooth rates and chunking
4) scatter with linear regression correlation stat and barplots
