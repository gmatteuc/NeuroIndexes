Giulio's personal neural data analysis toolkit.

This repository is intended as a sparse toolkit for neural data analysis, provideing functions and example scripts for neural and behavioral data anlysis in Matlab. In mywork sometimes I find myself repeating over and over some kind of analysis with slight variations across different projects and dataset, for some of these analysis "primitives" i decided to produce some small example scrips providing the code to run them and explaining how to use it. I've been also asked several times to share code to compute some selectivity indexes to quantify some neuronal properties, here I decided to make some of them freely available so that anyone wanting to use them is free to dowload them directly from herer. This toolkit is an ongoing side project of mine without any pretense of completeness and is intended for both personal use and for whoever might fin dit helpful. Over time I aim to buld a larger and larger library of clear, reusable (and possibly efficient) code for plotting, manipulation, and exploration of neuronal and behavioral data.

1. comparing_medians_of_distributions:
Functions and scripts for thoroughly comparing the medians of different distributions, needed over over in any neuroscience project.

2. comparing_psychometric_curves:
Tools for comparing psychometric curves, including example scripts. ---> TODO (missing)

3. computing_pattern_and_component_index:
A working version of scripts and functions to compute "pattern" and "component" indices need to quantify the type of visual motion selectivity of a neuron.

4. computing_phase_modulation_index:
A working version of scripts and functions to compute a phase modulation index need to quantify a visual neuron as more or less "simple" or "complex" like.

5. computing_prelick_modulation_index:
A working version of scripts and functions to compute a pre-lick (or pre-action) modulation index need to quantify (decisional?) modulations of sensory neurons by upcoming motor actions.

6. computing_visual_selectivity_indexes:
A collection of functions for computing various common visual selectivity indices. ---> TODO (finish)

7. converting_pvalues_in_ci_and_back:
Functions for converting p-values to confidence intervals and vice versa under normality assumption.

8. inspecting_correlation_of_distributions:
Tools for inspecting the correlation across different bivariate distributions, another kind of analysis needed over over in most neuroscience project.

9. inspecting_visual_neuron_responses:
Scripts and functions for illustrating how to inspect and preprocess visual neuron responses in an experiment with grating and sparse noise stimuli. ---> TODO (missing)

10. computing_spike_triggered_average:
A working version of scripts and functions to compute a z-scored spike triggered average from dense noise responses ---> TODO (missing)
